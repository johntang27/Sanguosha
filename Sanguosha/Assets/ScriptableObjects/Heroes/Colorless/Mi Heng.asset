  cardDescription: "Title: The Hawk that Pecks the Phoenix\n      \nHealth/Gender:
    3M\n\nAbility:\n\nMadness:\nAt the beginning of your main phase, you may perform
    a judgement. Cards that share the same suit as the judgement result ignore any
    range restrictions and any limit restrictions; if you play a card that shares
    the same suit as the judgement result, you may draw a card.\n(You may draw up
    to a max of 5 cards per turn with this ability. Ignoring limit restrictions means
    you may also ignore the ATTACK restriction limit rule and any rulings that only
    allow you to play any cards once per turn or main phase.)\n\nSharp Tongue:\nAt
    the end of your discard phase, if the cards you've discarded all have different
    suits, you may discard a card from another target hero.\n(You must discard more
    than 1 card during your discard phase to activate this ability.)\n"
