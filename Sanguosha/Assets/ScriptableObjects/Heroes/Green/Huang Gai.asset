    Injury:

    Once during your main phase, you may discard a card; then you lose

    Whenever you lose 1 health, draw 3 cards.

    Whenever
    you lose health during your main phase, you may play an additional ATTACK this
    turn; until the end of your turn, RED ATTACKs you play ignore all range requirements
    and cannot be canceled by a DODGE.

    (This ability does not activate when
    you are dealt damage, only when damage recieved is counted as loss of health.)
