    Ability:


    Showing Affection:

    Once per round, whenever a hero
    enters the brink of death, you may choose another target hero to draw 4 cards;
    then the targeted hero must discards 4 cards. If each discarded card has a different
    suit, this is treated as the targeted hero playing a PEACH for the hero on the
    brink of death.


    Silent Knowledge:

    At the end of your turn, you may
    play a card from your hand as the first basic or tactics card you have played
    this turn.

    Then you may play another card from your hand as the second basic
    or tactics card you have played this turn.

    (You must play the first card
    before being able to play the second card for their effects.)
